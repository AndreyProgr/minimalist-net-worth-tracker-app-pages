  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: 2025-05-27</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Net Worth Tracker (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles your information. By using the app, you agree to the terms described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Currently, Minimalist Net Worth Tracker does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All data you input is stored locally on your device using secure storage methods.</p>

  <p>If future versions of the app include cloud syncing or online services, we will clearly communicate what data is collected and why. We will only collect data that is necessary for the core functionality and will not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing.</p>

  <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app may request permission to access device storage or other system capabilities, but only for features directly related to user functionality. No personal data is accessed or used without user action.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Currently, the app uses no third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. If this changes in future versions, this policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use standard local storage security methods provided by the device operating system (such as AsyncStorage). However, no storage method is 100% secure. Use at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>As a user, you have full control of your data since it is stored locally. If future updates introduce cloud-based features, you will have the right to access, modify, or delete your data at any time.</p>

  <h2>6. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>This app is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind. We are not responsible for any data loss, financial loss, or damages resulting from the use or misuse of this app.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated in the future. The latest version will always be available at this page. Continued use of the app means you accept any revised terms.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or concerns about this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:a.harkovets@gmail.com" style="color: #66f;">a.harkovets@gmail.com</a>.</p>
